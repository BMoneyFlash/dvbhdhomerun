General:

* Check documentation for references.


+ upstart, check last post from silicondust.
  + use net-device-up IFACE!=lo?

+ Respawn so that crashes won't hurt us:


Kernel Module:

* Kernel 3.3 borks kernel driver. Use DVBv5 (ticket 8)

* Remove unneeded DVB functions.

* Init:
  * Need error checking in _init function

* Debug
  * Decide which functions to put under each bit pattern.

+ Use HDHomeRun ID in the device name.

UserHDHomerun:

* Need to use conf file to configure number of tuners?

* Use strstr on "atsc"/"cablecard" or "dvbt" to autodetect.

* Timestamp in log?

* Add locking of tuner?


+ Patch from Paul C. Prime.
  + MAX_TUNERS=2 get rid of that, use values from struct if available.

+ Log that DVB-C is used when dvbt is reported.

+ Can we fail writing logfiles? (ticket 5).

+ Disable/enable tuners in conf file. Default enable.
